## Projects

### [Fiber Management ETL Automation](https://github.com/yourusername/fiber-management-etl)
*Automated the process of converting and integrating spatial data from various formats for fiber management systems.*

- **Technologies:** Python, ArcGIS, FME
- **Summary:** Developed an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to handle data conversion and integration for fiber management systems. This involved extracting spatial data from CAD and KMZ formats, adding necessary attribution, validating and modifying geometries, and importing the cleaned and formatted data into fiber management systems. The process ensured data consistency and accuracy, improving overall efficiency in managing fiber optic network projects.

### [Infrastructure and Asset Management Dashboard](https://github.com/yourusername/infrastructure-dashboard)
*Aggregated data for infrastructure and asset management planning, focusing on fiber optics and municipal projects.*

- **Technologies:** Power BI, SQL, Tableau, ArcGIS Dashboards
- **Summary:** Developed a solution for aggregating data from various databases to support infrastructure and asset management planning for fiber optic networks and municipal projects in the Rural Municipality of Stanley. The process involved extracting and consolidating data from multiple sources, ensuring data consistency and accuracy, and creating interactive dashboards using Power BI and ArcGIS Dashboards. These dashboards provided valuable insights into asset management and infrastructure planning, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency.

### [Remote Sensing for Drainage and Culvert Planning](https://github.com/yourusername/remote-sensing-drainage-culvert)
*Advanced remote sensing analysis for drainage planning and culvert asset management.*

- **Technologies:** Python, ArcGIS, Remote Sensing Software, DJI Mavic Drones, SiteScan Photogrammetry Software
- **Summary:** Applied advanced remote sensing techniques, including multispectral and LiDAR analysis, using DJI Mavic drones and SiteScan photogrammetry software to determine optimal drainage plans and extract culvert assets. The project involved using digital elevation models (DEMs) and high-resolution multispectral imagery to analyze hydrological patterns, perform terrain analysis, and conduct culvert sizing and placement analysis. This data was integrated into GIS for creating detailed drainage models and assessing culvert infrastructure, aiding in effective water management and infrastructure planning.
